# Demo Integration Status Update for Review Session 1

## Project Title: Echoes of the Forgotten

## Status Update (As of End of Next Week, e.g., Oct 20, 2023 if today is Oct 10)
The Forgotten Forest prototype demo for the upcoming Team Review Session 1 is currently in a [to be finalized: playable state for live gameplay with screen-sharing, pending final integration and stability checks by mid-next week; alternative: verbal walkthrough state with descriptive aids if full integration isn’t complete]. Key implementations in `game_core.ts` include the echo overlay system for the bridge puzzle on Overgrown Trail (collision toggles, 30-second duration, Resonance cost: 20 to activate, 5/sec sustain) and combat mechanics near Ritual Path (3-second stun within 100 pixels, Shaman’s Whisper shield for 10 seconds at 15 Resonance). Visual effects are integrated at a basic level with WebGL shader support for echo state shifts (cyan-blue tint) via `shaders.ts`, with placeholders for radial pulse and particles pending final assets from the Art Director. Any outstanding integration gaps (e.g., full visual effects or minor stability tweaks) will be verbally described during the session if a live demo isn’t fully stable. The demo is on track for presentation readiness, with a fallback to a detailed verbal walkthrough supported by textual aids (e.g., `demo_visual_aid.md`) if needed, ensuring a clear showcase of core mechanics for actionable feedback during the review.
