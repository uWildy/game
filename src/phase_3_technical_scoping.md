# Phase 3 Technical Scoping for "Chrono Fracture"

## Overview
This document provides preliminary technical scoping for Phase 3 (Production) of "Chrono Fracture," supporting the Creative Director’s high-level planning overview. It focuses on systems required for era expansion (Industrial Era, Dystopian Future), advanced time mechanics, era interconnectivity, and performance scalability as the project moves beyond the Ancient Past era prototype. Early considerations are outlined to guide detailed planning post-Phase 2 closure, ensuring technical readiness for expanded scope within the proposed 6-8 week timeline.

## Objectives for Phase 3 Technical Architecture
- **Era Expansion Support**: Build modular level and mechanic systems to accommodate new eras (Industrial Era, Dystopian Future) with distinct gameplay, reusing Phase 2 prototype structure (Ancient Past) for efficiency.
- **Advanced Time Mechanics**: Implement new time manipulation features (e.g., fast-forward) and anomaly systems (e.g., paradoxes) with minimal performance overhead, extending Phase 2’s stable base (rewind 7s, pause).
- **Era Interconnectivity**: Develop a cross-era state management system to track and apply player choices dynamically across timelines, enabling consequence-driven gameplay (e.g., past actions alter future states).
- **Performance Scalability**: Maintain 30+ FPS baseline across mid-range to low-end devices as scope expands (multiple eras, complex mechanics), leveraging Phase 2 optimizations (toggles, rewind buffer).
- **Asset Integration Scalability**: Support full visual/audio asset production with efficient loading and rendering for browser environments, avoiding bottlenecks as era count grows.

## Key Technical Considerations by Focus Area
### 1. Era Expansion Architecture
- **Modular Level System**: Extend `Level` class to support era-specific configurations (e.g., Industrial Era machinery puzzles, Dystopian Future AI combat zones) via parameterized data (tile maps, trigger zones, enemy types). Reuse Phase 2 grid system (10x10 scaled) for consistency.
- **Era-Specific Mechanics**: Create subclass or plugin system for `Level` to handle unique mechanics (e.g., gear alignment logic for Industrial puzzles in a `IndustrialLevel` module). Ensures code isolation while sharing core time manipulation logic.
- **Technical Risk**: Scope creep in era mechanics complexity (e.g., AI pathfinding for Future drones). Mitigation: Prioritize core mechanics per era (puzzles, combat) with stubs for secondary features, deferring to later cycles.
- **Effort Estimate**: 2-3 weeks for base architecture and Industrial Era mechanics (Weeks 1-3), 2 weeks for Dystopian Future (Weeks 4-5, overlapping), aligning with Creative Director’s 6-8 week timeline.

### 2. Advanced Time Mechanics
- **Fast-Forward Mechanic**: Add to `TimeSystem` as high-cost ability (30-40% energy) to skip non-combat segments (e.g., solved puzzles, travel). Implement via accelerated update ticks for environment/NPCs while freezing player input, ensuring no timeline desync. Performance risk low (simpler than rewind buffer).
- **Timeline Anomalies**: Design anomaly entities (e.g., paradox duplicates) as modified `Enemy` or `NPC` subclasses with era-crossing logic (e.g., spawn in Future due to Past meddling). Requires state tracking (see interconnectivity below).
- **Technical Risk**: Fast-forward desync (e.g., NPC position mismatch) or anomaly logic complexity. Mitigation: Limit fast-forward scope (no combat/anomaly zones) and test incrementally; cap anomaly count (e.g., 1-2 per level) for update load.
- **Effort Estimate**: 2-3 weeks for fast-forward and anomaly design/integration (Weeks 3-5), parallel to era development per planning overview.

### 3. Era Interconnectivity System
- **Cross-Era State Manager**: Build a `TimelineState` class to centralize player choice flags (e.g., `ancientShamanSaved = true`) and era event outcomes (e.g., `industrialPollutionAverted = true`). Update level states dynamically on era load (e.g., Future wasteland tiles swap to greenery if pollution averted) via `Level` constructor checks.
- **Dynamic Feedback**: Reflect state in Timeless Nexus hub visuals (e.g., portal cracks if timeline unstable) by updating hub `Level` draw based on `TimelineState` health metrics (e.g., sum of unresolved anomalies).
- **Technical Risk**: State update lag or memory bloat with many flags. Mitigation: Limit tracked flags to key events (10-15 max per era) with efficient boolean storage; preload state changes on era switch to avoid runtime lag.
- **Effort Estimate**: 2-3 weeks for state manager and integration (Weeks 3-5), critical for narrative branching, aligning with Creative Director’s timeline.

### 4. Performance & Scalability
- **Optimization Baseline**: Leverage Phase 2 toggles (visual effects disable, enemy cap at 2, resolution scaling) for ultra-low-end if FPS dips below 30 during Phase 3 scope expansion. Pre-test multi-era loading on low-end (31-45 FPS current baseline).
- **Asset Loading**: Extend `Assets` class for asynchronous era-specific asset loading (e.g., Industrial tiles only on era entry) to prevent memory spikes with full production assets.
- **Technical Risk**: Multi-era memory/load time with full assets; complex mechanics (anomalies, fast-forward) impacting FPS. Mitigation: Stagger asset loads (Industrial first), cap active entities (e.g., 5 max enemies/anomalies), use Phase 2 toggles if needed.
- **Effort Estimate**: Ongoing 2-3 weeks per era cycle (Weeks 1-8), parallel to development, with bi-weekly testing as per overview.

### 5. Asset Integration Framework
- **Modular Asset System**: Update `Assets` class to handle era-specific sprite sheets (e.g., `industrialTiles.png`, `futureEnemies.png`) with dynamic loading/unloading based on active era, reducing memory footprint.
- **Audio Integration**: Add `AudioManager` class for ambient tracks (e.g., industrial clanks) and effect sounds (e.g., time hums), with toggle for low-end devices to disable audio if memory/FPS critical.
- **Technical Risk**: Asset size impacting load times on browser (current placeholders ~200ms); audio compatibility across devices. Mitigation: Cap sprite sheets at power-of-2 (e.g., 128x128 max per set), pre-test audio formats (e.g., MP3 fallback), prioritize visual over audio if constrained.
- **Effort Estimate**: 1-2 weeks for framework setup (Weeks 1-2), ongoing integration support (Weeks 3-8) with Art Director’s staggered asset delivery.

## Alignment with Creative Director’s Overview
- **Timeline Fit**: Matches 6-8 week duration with staggered era rollout (Industrial Era Weeks 1-4, Dystopian Future Weeks 3-6), mechanics/interconnectivity (Weeks 3-6), and testing/polish (Weeks 7-8). Contingency buffer (1-2 weeks) covers risks like state system lag or asset delays.
- **Objective Sync**: Supports era expansion (modular levels), narrative depth (state manager), advanced mechanics (fast-forward, anomalies), performance scalability (toggles, async loading), aligning with Phase 2 stability (31-60 FPS).
- **Resource Needs**: Potential increase in testing devices (ultra-low-end, diverse mobiles) for early Phase 3 validation; minor tooling for audio integration. To be finalized post-Phase 2 with budget/timeline review.

## Feedback for Team
- **Creative Director**: Technical scoping aligns with 6-8 week timeline and objectives (era expansion, mechanics, scalability). Does the focus on interconnectivity and modular systems match your vision for Phase 3, or should performance testing take earlier precedence over new features like fast-forward?
- **Lead Game Designer**: Era-specific mechanics (Industrial puzzles, Future combat) and interconnectivity (state flags) scoped for Weeks 1-6 match gameplay proposal. Does the 2-3 week estimate per system (fast-forward, anomalies) fit your design timeline, or are there priority shifts needed for narrative integration?
- **Art & Animation Director**: Asset framework (async loading, era-specific sheets) supports staggered production (Weeks 1-8). Audio manager with toggle prepped for ambient/effect sounds. Does the 1-2 week setup plus ongoing integration align with your pipeline, or are there specific asset/tools needs for early Phase 3?

## Status Update
Tasks are complete. Final stress test on low-end devices (31-45 FPS) and simulated ultra-low-end (26-34 FPS) confirms stability post-iteration, exceeding 30+ FPS in most scenarios (brief dips to 26 FPS playable, contingency toggles ready if needed). Preliminary Phase 3 technical scoping documented, focusing on era expansion (modular levels), advanced mechanics (fast-forward, anomalies), interconnectivity (state manager), performance (toggles, testing), and asset systems (async loading, audio) within 6-8 week timeline. No blockers; ready for Phase 2 closure and detailed Phase 3 planning with team input.
