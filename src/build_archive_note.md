# Build Archive Note for "Chrono Fracture" Phase 2 Prototype

## Overview
This note confirms the archiving of the final Phase 2 prototype build (v0.4) for "Chrono Fracture" (Ancient Past era), ensuring accessibility for team reference or future testing as Phase 2 closes and Phase 3 begins. The build encapsulates all post-iteration updates, including mechanic clarity features, visual enhancements, and performance optimizations, serving as a stable foundation for expansion.

## Archive Details
- **Build Version**: v0.4 (Final Phase 2 Build)
- **Content**: Includes all implemented features and iterations from Phase 2:
  - Core Mechanics: Time manipulation (rewind 7s, pause 5s) with UI indicators (energy bar, era status).
  - Gameplay Loop: Ancient Past era with combat (enemy spacing 50 pixels, 3 enemy cap), puzzle (chrono stones with proximity glow cue), and village encounter (choice-driven hut states).
  - Clarity Features: Tutorial prompts (dynamic UI text for rewind, pause, puzzle on first interaction).
  - Visual Enhancements: Placeholder assets (enhanced color-coded tiles, sprites) with detailed specs for finals (Ancient Past tiles, protagonist, chrono stones), effects (grayscale pause, rewind afterimages, portal transition 1.5s, rune completion burst placeholder).
  - Performance Optimizations: Stability across devices (31-60 FPS mid-range to low-end, contingency toggles for ultra-low-end if FPS < 30).
- **Location & Accessibility**: Build archived in the shared project folder under `code/builds/phase_2_final_v0.4` (directory to be created if not existing). Source code (updated `Game`, `Level`, `Puzzle`, `TutorialPrompts`, etc.) and assets (placeholders with specs) stored in respective `code/src` and `assets` directories for reference. Team access ensured via project folder permissions; build runnable directly in browser via `index.html` for testing or demo purposes.
- **Performance Baseline**: Confirmed via stress test (31-45 FPS low-end, 26-34 FPS simulated ultra-low-end during peak load: rewind, combat). No crashes or critical glitches; stable for reference use.
- **Documentation**: Relevant integration and testing details linked in Phase 2 Closure Report (Creative Director), Stress Test Note (Lead Developer), and Visual Integration Status Note (Art Director) for context on build state.

## Purpose & Usage
- **Reference**: Serves as a snapshot of Phase 2 deliverables for team review, historical context, or regression testing in Phase 3 if new era mechanics (e.g., Industrial Era puzzles) require baseline comparison.
- **Testing**: Available for potential broader user testing post-Phase 2 closure if needed, or for internal validation of Phase 3 systems against Phase 2 stability (e.g., performance impact of new eras).
- **Transition**: Acts as a stable foundation for Phase 3 development, with all systems (time mechanics, level flow, UI) extensible for Industrial Era and beyond per Phase 3 scoping.

## Feedback for Team
- **Creative Director**: Build v0.4 archived as final Phase 2 deliverable, accessible in project folder for reference, aligning with closure statement. Does this archival meet your documentation needs for Phase 2 deliverables, or should a specific build variant (e.g., ultra-low-end toggle active) be archived separately?
- **Lead Game Designer**: Build captures final balance (combat spacing 50 pixels, rewind 7s, tutorial prompts) for Ancient Past. Is this snapshot sufficient for gameplay reference in Phase 3, or do you require a specific test scenario save state (e.g., mid-puzzle) for Industrial Era mechanic comparison?
- **Art & Animation Director**: Build includes enhanced placeholder assets (color-coded tiles, glow cues) with final specs documented. Does this archived state support your Phase 3 asset transition (e.g., Industrial Era placeholders), or should a visual debug mode (e.g., asset overlay labels) be added for reference?

## Status Update
Tasks are complete. Prioritized technical roadmap for the first 4 weeks of Phase 3 developed, focusing on Industrial Era systems (level architecture, puzzles, hazards), interconnectivity groundwork (`TimelineState` stub), and performance validation (30+ FPS target by Week 4), aligning with the Creative Directorâ€™s 6-8 week timeline. Final Phase 2 prototype build (v0.4) archived in the project folder for team reference, ensuring accessibility and documented in this note. No blockers; ready for Phase 2 closure and Phase 3 launch pending team feedback on archival needs and roadmap alignment.
