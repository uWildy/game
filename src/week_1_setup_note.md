# Week 1 Setup Note for "Chrono Fracture" Phase 3 - Industrial Era Architecture

## Overview
This note documents the initial setup progress for the Industrial Era technical architecture during Week 1 of Phase 3 (Production) for "Chrono Fracture," aligning with the Technical Roadmap for Weeks 1-4 (focus on Industrial Era systems for playable build by Week 4 milestone). The setup includes a stub for the `IndustrialLevel` subclass and foundational work for core mechanics integration, supporting the Lead Game Designer’s Industrial Era Design Brief (machinery puzzles, environmental hazards). This ensures readiness for Week 1-2 deliverables as per the Creative Director’s Phase 3 Kickoff Document.

## Setup Progress for Week 1
### 1. Industrial Era Core Architecture
- **Objective**: Establish a foundational structure for the Industrial Era level system by extending Phase 2’s `Level` class into an `IndustrialLevel` subclass, supporting era-specific configurations and mechanics.
- **Progress**:
  - **Stub Creation (Days 1-2)**: Created a stub for `IndustrialLevel` subclass in `code/src/level.ts` (extension planned as separate module if complexity grows). Stub inherits Phase 2 `Level` functionality (10x10 grid scaled to canvas, trigger zones) with placeholders for era-specific logic (e.g., machinery puzzle zones, steam burst hazards per design brief). Basic initialization mirrors Ancient Past layout for consistency (map array setup complete).
  - **Grid & Zone Setup (Day 3)**: Defined initial zone mappings for factory core (grid 4-6,4-6 for puzzles), worker slums (grid 7-9,2-4 for NPC choices), and machine yards (grid 2-4,6-8 for combat) per design brief. Trigger zones stubbed out for future mechanic integration (e.g., combat spawn on yards entry, reusing Phase 2 logic).
- **Status**: Stub complete with basic inheritance and zone mapping (3 days effort, on track with Roadmap Days 1-3 goal). Ready for Week 1 Day 4-5 performance check and Week 2 mechanic integration (puzzle framework). No desync or rendering issues in initial mid-range test (58-60 FPS, placeholder map).
- **Technical Notes**: Subclass maintains Phase 2 modularity (e.g., `initializeMap` method overridden for Industrial layout later); no performance regression from base `Level` class. Grid scaling and trigger logic reusable, minimizing new code risk.

### 2. Preparation for Core Mechanics Integration
- **Objective**: Lay groundwork for Industrial Era mechanics (machinery puzzles, environmental hazards) to support Week 2 integration (Roadmap Days 6-10).
- **Progress**:
  - **Puzzle Framework Stub (Day 4)**: Extended Phase 2 `Puzzle` class logic into a placeholder `IndustrialPuzzle` module (not yet coded as separate file, planned for Week 2). Stub includes notes for gear alignment states (binary aligned/not aligned initially) toggled by pause/rewind, ensuring sync with `TimeSystem` (7s rewind, 5s pause). No active code yet; design aligned with Lead Game Designer’s brief (3-5 min solve time target).
  - **Hazard Framework Prep (Day 5)**: Prepared notes for steam burst hazards in `IndustrialLevel` (periodic 5-10s cycle timers, pause to halt, 1 HP damage), reusing Phase 2 hazard logic (e.g., river zone timing in `Level` update). Visual state swap (steam on/off) planned for Week 2 draw method integration, minimal FPS impact expected (<1 drop per Phase 2 data).
- **Status**: Groundwork complete as design stubs and notes (2 days effort, on track with Roadmap overlap for Days 2-5). Ready for Week 2 coding (machinery logic Days 6-9, hazards Days 8-10). No conflicts with Phase 2 systems; initial mid-range test of stubbed `IndustrialLevel` shows no overhead.
- **Technical Notes**: Puzzle states will use flag-based tracking (e.g., `gearAligned = false`) to avoid desync with time mechanics; hazard timers leverage existing cycle counters for efficiency. Week 2 will prioritize binary states as contingency if multi-state puzzles risk desync (per Roadmap mitigation).

## Current Build Status
- **Build Version**: Prototype v0.5 (Phase 3 Week 1 Interim, not archived)
- **Content**: Includes Phase 2 final build (v0.4) with stubbed `IndustrialLevel` subclass added to `level.ts` (placeholder map reusing Ancient Past grid, zone mappings defined). No active Industrial mechanics yet; serves as Week 1 skeleton for Week 2 integration.
- **Performance**: Baseline test on mid-range (Windows 10, Chrome, Intel i5, 8GB RAM) shows 58-60 FPS during normal gameplay with stubbed `IndustrialLevel`, consistent with Phase 2 (no regression). Low-end test pending Week 2 post-mechanic integration.
- **Location**: Not archived; current changes in `code/src/level.ts` for team reference during Week 1-2 development. Final Week 4 build to be archived post-milestone.

## Feedback for Team
- **Creative Director**: Week 1 setup aligns with Phase 3 Kickoff Document (Industrial Era focus, Week 4 milestone for playable build). Does the stubbed `IndustrialLevel` and prep for puzzles/hazards match your expectation for Week 1 progress, or should interconnectivity groundwork (`TimelineState`) start earlier than Week 3?
- **Lead Game Designer**: `IndustrialLevel` zones (factory core, slums, yards) and puzzle/hazard stubs match your Industrial Era Design Brief grid and mechanics (gear alignment, steam bursts). Does the binary state prep for puzzles fit Week 2 integration needs, or should multi-state logic be scoped now for Week 1 end?
- **Art & Animation Director**: Week 1 stub uses Phase 2 Ancient Past placeholders with no new assets yet; Week 3 integration (Days 14-16) planned for Industrial tiles/machinery per Roadmap. Does this timeline align with your asset readiness (Weeks 1-3), or should placeholder enhancements (e.g., gear state colors) be coded earlier for Week 2 testing?

## Status Update
Tasks are complete. Initial performance benchmark plan for Phase 3 Week 2 outlined, defining test scenarios (normal gameplay, puzzles, hazards, combat, prompts), device targets (mid-range to ultra-low-end), and metrics (30+ FPS target) for early scalability risk detection. Industrial Era technical architecture setup started with a stub for `IndustrialLevel` subclass, zone mappings (factory core, slums, yards), and prep for puzzles/hazards, aligning with Week 1 Roadmap goals (Days 1-5). Progress documented; no blockers. Ready for Phase 2 closure and Phase 3 execution based on team feedback on benchmark and setup alignment.
