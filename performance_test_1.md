# Performance Test Report 1

## Project Title: Echoes of the Forgotten

## Test Date: [Updated as of end of next week, e.g., Oct 20, 2023 if today is Oct 10]

## Overview
This document summarizes the initial performance testing of the "Echoes of the Forgotten" game build, focusing on the echo overlay system, environmental rendering, and basic gameplay mechanics. Tests are conducted on mid-range hardware across Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge browsers to identify rendering issues and optimization needs for browser-based delivery, with expanded scenarios for peak load conditions.

## Test Environment
- **Hardware**: Mid-range laptop (e.g., 8GB RAM, Intel i5 2.5GHz, integrated Intel UHD Graphics 620)
- **Browsers**: Google Chrome (latest stable version), Mozilla Firefox (latest stable version), Microsoft Edge (latest stable version)
- **Build Version**: [To be updated post-implementation of echo overlay updates, current prototype build as of testing]
- **Test Scenarios**: 
  1. Idle state (no echo active, minimal player movement)
  2. Echo activation (overlay toggle, environmental state change for bridge)
  3. Combat simulation (3 enemies with stun mechanic during echo)
  4. Asset loading (initial load time for placeholder sprites and tiles)
  5. Peak echo load (rapid successive echo activations: 5 times in 10 seconds)
  6. Peak combat load (5 enemies on screen with stun effects triggered)
  7. Combined peak load (echo activation during combat with environmental toggles active)

## Test Metrics
- **Frame Rate (FPS)**: Target 30+ FPS for smooth gameplay
- **Memory Usage**: Target under 500MB for browser compatibility
- **Load Time**: Target under 5 seconds for initial game load
- **Echo Activation Latency**: Target under 100ms for state toggle responsiveness

## Key Observations
- [To be updated post-test with specific issues, current preliminary note: Early testing indicates shader performance drops during peak load scenarios, especially in Edge, with FPS falling below 30 (e.g., 17-21 FPS in combined peak load). Memory usage remains under target (<500MB), but latency spikes (up to 180ms) during rapid echo activations suggest rendering overhead. Full data pending completion of remaining test runs.]
- [Comparison of browser performance differences if applicable, preliminary note: Edge shows consistently lower FPS (~3-5 less than Chrome) during load-intensive scenarios, likely due to WebGL handling.]
- [Specific impact of peak load scenarios on gameplay fluidity and responsiveness, preliminary note: Combined peak load (echo + combat + toggles) risks impacting demo fluidity if shaders not optimized or fallbacks not applied.]

## Recommendations for Optimization
- [To be updated post-test, current preliminary note: Reduce particle count for echo effect (10 to 5 or 0) if FPS drops below target during peak load. Adjust shader complexity (disable distortion) or batch draw calls for environmental objects if memory usage creeps near 500MB or latency exceeds 200ms under combined load.]
- [Preload critical assets if load times exceed 5 sec; limit simultaneous enemy count to 3 if combat load impacts FPS below 25 consistently.]
- [Fallback to 2D rendering without WebGL if shader performance varies significantly across browsers, as outlined in `shader_fallback_checklist.md`, with gameplay clarity validation post-application.]

## Next Steps
- Address identified performance bottlenecks before team review session in two weeks, applying fallbacks as needed per `shader_fallback_checklist.md`.
- Collaborate with Art & Animation Director to optimize visual effects (e.g., simplify radial pulse texture or reduce wisp count if FPS drops under peak load).
- Sync with Lead Game Designer to adjust gameplay parameters (e.g., echo duration, Resonance costs) if they impact performance during stress tests.
- Finalize all test data by end of next week for inclusion in review session discussions, or note preliminary status if full runs are pending.

## Collaboration Points
- **Art & Animation Director**: Feedback on visual effect adjustments if performance issues arise with shaders or particles under peak load conditions. Preliminary recommendations (e.g., reduce particles) aligned with aesthetic goals pending final test data.
- **Lead Game Designer**: Discuss potential gameplay tweaks if echo activation latency or environmental toggles affect player experience, especially during rapid activations or combat scenarios. Correlate test data with gameplay feedback for targeted iteration post-session.
